//! Native filesystem backend for Gravity Notes' folder storage.
//!
//! The web File System Access API is unavailable in macOS WKWebView, so the
//! folder-of-`.md`-files backend is served by these commands instead. They are
//! deliberately thin primitives over `std::fs` — all the note semantics (canonical
//! body shape, unique-name resolution, case-only rename, conflict detection) live in
//! TypeScript (`src/storage/tauriStore.ts`), mirroring `FileSystemNoteStore` so the
//! rest of the app is backend-agnostic.
//!
//! `dir` is the absolute path to the user-picked folder; `name` is a note id — now a
//! POSIX-relative path that may include subfolders (`Work/Sub/Title.md`) — or the
//! `.gravity-notes.json` metadata sidecar. Every caller-supplied path is run through
//! `resolve_within`, which rejects any attempt to escape the picked folder: this is the
//! ONLY containment defense, since the custom `notes_*` commands are not covered by the
//! fs-plugin's scope allowlist. Times are returned as epoch-millisecond `f64`s to match
//! the web backend's `file.lastModified`.
